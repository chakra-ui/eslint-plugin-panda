# file-not-included

Disallow the use of panda css in files that are not included in the specified panda `include` config.

📋 This rule is enabled in `plugin:@pandacss/all`.

📋 This rule is enabled in `plugin:@pandacss/recommended`.

## Rule details

✔️ Examples of **correct** code for a file named `App.tsx`:
```js
// File App.tsx is covered in the include config, so it's okay to import css and Circle from panda into it.

import { css } from './panda/css';
import { Circle } from './panda/jsx';
```

❌ Examples of **incorrect** code for a file named `Invalid.tsx`:
```js
// File Invalid.tsx is not covered in the include config, so imporing css and Circle from panda into it is not allowed.

import { css } from './panda/css';
import { Circle } from './panda/jsx';
```
